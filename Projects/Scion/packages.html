        <p>Not every business has the same needs when it comes to a presence on the internet. Some just need a simple way of letting the world know they exist, while others require many pages of information. Wherever your business may fall along the spectrum, Scion Web Design can build you a site that is a perfect fit.</p>

      	<p>A <strong>Business Card Website</strong> is a one-page announcement to the World Wide Web that you exist. It is inexpensive, easily maintained, and provides information about you or your business, contact details, links to other social profiles (think FaceBook, Twitter, etc.) Business card websites take on many forms. Like actual business cards, while many are very straightforward, nothing says you can't get a little creative.</p>

      	<div style="clear: both"></div>

      	<div class="package"><a href="brochure.html"><img src="images/brochure.png"><div class="ribbon-wrapper-green"><div class="ribbon-green">$495</div></div></a></div>

		<p>A <strong>Brochure Website</strong> provides a showcase of you or your business, along with all of the information you would expect to find: contact information, goods and services, pricing, location. Like a real brochure, the goal of this type of website is to give visitors a clear picture of who you are and what you do, in a few clear and easy to navigate pages.</p>

		<div style="clear: both"></div>

      	<div class="package"><a href="basic.html"><img src="images/basic-site.png"><div class="ribbon-wrapper-green"><div class="ribbon-green">$895</div></div></a></div>

		<p>Our <strong>Basic Business Website</strong> takes the concept of the brochure site and builds upon it, adding more information about you or your business. While for many small businesses a brochure site may be sufficient, some may require additional pages to provide visitors a complete and thorough understanding of who they are and what they do.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;">Click <a href="compare.html"> here </a>to compare our three packages.</p>
    
       <div class="round-corners"><h1>Additional Options</h1></div>
        <p><strong>Specialized Design:</strong>If your needs do not fit nicely into one of our packages, we can meet and determine exactly what you require to get your message out there. Whatever your needs are, Scion will do our best to meet them.</p>

        <p><strong>Site Maintenance:</strong>We can provide site maintenance to all of the sites we design, and may also be able to service your pre-exisitng as well. Each design package comes with some "post-launch" maintenance time built in. All other site maintenance time is billed at a rate of $40 per hour, or a maintenance plan can be purchased to achieve a reduced rate.</p>

        <p><strong>Hosting:</strong>Unless you have other hosting arrangements, Scion will host your site for you. In fact, the first year of hosting (along with domain name registration) is included in all of our design packages. We will continue to host your site and ensure your domain remains registered to you on an annual basis for an extremely reasonable cost.</p>
