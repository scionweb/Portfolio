				<h2>What Our Students Are Saying</h2>
				<br />
				<blockquote>I'm so thankful that I was encouraged by my physician to start taking yoga classes with Elaine several months ago. The first evening that I walked into her space, I knew that I was in the right place. Elaine's gentle and kind way of teaching has changed my life in a HUGE way. She has taught me to be as kind and loving with myself as I am with everyone else in my life. Thank You Elaine for your time, energy, love and devotion. You truly offer a special gift to all of us. ~ Connie Hamel</blockquote>

				<blockquote>Lisa is an authentic teacher who meets the world with an open heart and sets a good example. People respond to her teaching because in her class everyone feels the love. She balances devotion without becoming too serious. Everyone is safe, comfortable, loved. People love to the best of their ability and having Lisa as a teacher has increased my ability to be loving towards others. ~ Bob H</blockquote>

				<blockquote>I am 72 years old. I have been practicing yoga at Essex Yoga Coop for about 7 years. The physical and mental changes have been amazing, if I do say so myself! I feel younger, stronger, more open than I did at 40. I am much calmer and more accepting than I was then. Essex Yoga Coop and its excellent teachers have changed my life. ~ Patty H.</blockquote>

				<blockquote>Dave, thank you for clearly and passionately following what is obviously (to me, for sure!) God's will for your life! You have already made a difference in my yoga practice and that difference is positively impacting my life. Bless you! ~ Gina Maguire</blockquote>
