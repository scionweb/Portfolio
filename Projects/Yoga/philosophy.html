				<h2>Our Philosphy</h2>
				<p><b>Balance is a Must</b> - Balance is the core of the Essex Yoga Coop. Being balanced decreases stress, prevents disease, and keeps us happy and healthy. To facilitate balance we provide a full spectrum of yoga classes, AND encourage students to explore and be engaged in other forms of exercise to maintain a balanced lifestyle. Get back to nature! Continue to walk, run, hike, bike, ski, snowboard, swim, or participate in any other form of exercise you may enjoy. We also believe in balance through nutrition. A healthy diet varies for everyone, and at Essex Yoga Coop we inspire our students to discover what food choices support their needs and their bodies.  Our goal is to help you live a long, healthy and FUN life that is balanced in every way.</p>
				<br />
				<p><b>We Love Beginner Yoga</b> - Essex Yoga Coop caters to all levels of yogis but we have a special passion for folks who have never stepped foot onto a yoga mat, much less into a studio. Being a beginning yoga student can be scary and intimidating so we do our very best to make you feel at home in our community by knowing your name and giving you as much personal attention as desired.</p>
				<br />
				<p><b>Healing Rules</b> - The "H" word can be scary and often is associated with things like painful psychotherapy sessions and tearful times in our lives. At Essex Yoga Coop we work hard to re-educate students that healing is actually a lovely little byproduct of doing all types of yoga. That if you are conscious of your body in your yoga practice, feel into your emotions and move through them, you ARE healing - physically, emotionally and spiritually. It doesn't have to be cataclysmic...it's as easy as stepping onto your mat!</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Our Motto</h2>
				<p>It is way too easy, especially in the American culture, to coast through life in a state of numbness - being "checked out" physically, emotionally, and/or spiritually.  "Feeling is Living" is about encouraging you to feel your body during yoga practice and instruction - to get in touch with the sensation and be curious about it. It also encompasses feeling your emotions. To simply witness whatever comes up (without judgment), and attempt to see how they can serve your healing process. And finally, to feel into and embody your true spirit - to live as your spirit dictates and connect with the greater power and energy of the Universe.  Once you are connected to yourself physically, emotionally and spiritually, you are then connected to everything else around you and truly feel alive! Feeling IS Living!! </p>
				<br />
				<h2>Essex Yoga Coop</h2>
				<p>Essex Yoga Coop offers the Essex community a variety of yoga classes, instruction & yoga workshops for beginner to advanced yogis. Our goal is to help people cultivate awareness and connection through yoga, and a balanced lifestyle - thus our moto is "Feeling is Living!" Please join us at the yoga studio for one of our healthy lifestyle events, like our fall and spring nutrition programs, forrest yoga events, art events, outdoor classes and more!  We now offer yoga teacher training. Don't hesitate to contact us with any questions. Namaste! </p>
